This file is intended as a placeholder for future development of item-related models.

The purpose of this file is to outline and implement models related to items, which may include but are not limited to, representations of physical or digital items that can be managed, tracked, or manipulated within the application.

As of now, this file does not contain any implementations. It is reserved for future development when item-related functionalities become necessary for the project.
